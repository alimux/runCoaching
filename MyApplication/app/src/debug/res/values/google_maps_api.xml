    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    E1:D9:0A:1F:C8:8D:9D:3E:AE:49:7F:36:CC:E2:64:27:4C:8B:C7:49;dnr2i.coaching.run.runcoaching

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
